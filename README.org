#+TITLE: live-whisper
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

Speech-to-text overlay for Hyprland. Press a hotkey, speak, and the
transcribed text is typed into the previously focused window. No need to hold
any button — just talk and watch the transcription appear in real time. Edit it
if needed, hit Enter to send (with optional automatic Enter keypress), or
Escape to cancel. Great for dictating into chat, filling in forms, or talking
to coding agents without touching the keyboard.

* How It Works

1. Press a global hotkey (configured in Hyprland)
2. A layer-shell overlay appears at the bottom of the screen with exclusive keyboard focus
3. Microphone capture starts immediately, transcription appears live
4. Edit the text if needed, then:
   - *Enter* — accept and type text into the previously focused window
   - *Escape* — cancel and close

Text is typed into the target window via the =zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1= Wayland
protocol (no external tools like =wtype= needed). Focus capture and restore
uses =hyprctl=.

* Building

#+begin_src sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
#+end_src

The whisper.cpp tiny model (~75 MB) is downloaded automatically on first build.

** System Dependencies

Arch Linux:

#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S wayland wayland-protocols libxkbcommon egl-wayland mesa cmake
#+end_src

Everything else (whisper.cpp, miniaudio, Dear ImGui) is fetched automatically
via CMake FetchContent.

Runtime: =hyprctl= (included with Hyprland).

* Installation

#+begin_src sh
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local
#+end_src

This installs the binary to =~/.local/bin/= and the model to
=~/.local/share/live-whisper/=.

* Hyprland Configuration

#+begin_src conf
bind = $mod, V, exec, ~/.local/bin/live-whisper
#+end_src

** Streaming via Chunk Commit

whisper.cpp is batch-oriented. Live transcription is achieved by processing
audio in chunks:

- Accumulate audio and run =whisper_full()= every ~2 seconds
- Each chunk's text is committed immediately (append-only, never re-transcribed)
- Prompt tokens from the last segment carry forward for context continuity
- A 0.5s audio overlap between chunks ensures smooth boundaries

** Source Layout

  overlay.h / overlay.cpp   — Wayland layer-shell surface + EGL + input
